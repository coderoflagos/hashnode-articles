# Introduction to Vezgo

Are you looking for a **Zabo Alternative?** You are in the right place. Vezgo is here to help you. In this article, I will be explaining a lot about this new service. 

Since Zabo has been sold to Coinbase, Wealthica launched a Crypto API as a service, Vezgo. It’s mainly for Fintech Product Developers. Vezgo was created to make things easy to make things accessible by powering apps with crypto exchange. In other words, it is an API for connecting any cryptocurrency account. ​​Vezgo is continuing to serve its subscribers when it comes to tracking its crypto assets.


## Vezgo as a meta API

Vezgo is not the regular type of API you all know, it is the easiest way for people to connect crypto accounts to your app. With Vezgo, things have been pretty much accessible. It was launched by Wealthica in October 2021, and so far, we can call it the new “Plaid” of Crypto. There’s something everyone needs to understand about Wealthica, and that is; for end-users, Vezgo makes it easy to connect to any crypto exchange wallet, or accounts to retrieve balances, holdings, and transactions making it more accessible for people to connect their crypto accounts to any app. For Fintech Developers, it’s something cool too, but a bit different from how it is for end-users. For Fintech Developers, Vezgo is designed to make things easier to power apps with crypto exchange and wallet data by reducing integration lead. Vezgo API currently connects with over 30 crypto institutions, including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Celcius, and many more, for integration.

Vezgo API employs industry-leading practices with AES-256 encryption, secure cloud infrastructure, and compliance with SOC2 Type 2 - it does not store private keys.
