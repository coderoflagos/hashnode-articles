# Agility DEV Series: Joshua Isaac ‚ö°

Hello, Awesome üëãüèø,

Thanks for taking out time to read this written interview. In this interview series, I'll be having great developers at Agility CMS to share their experiences with using Agility CMS and their experience with JAMstack tools too.

Today, I'll be interviewing  [Joshua Isaac](https://twitter.com/joshu____a) üéâüéâüéä.

## So, Joshua can you tell us a little bit about yourself. How and when did you venture into Agility CMS?

**Joshua:** My name is Joshua, I'm a front-end web developer who is experienced in creating custom WordPress and Shopify themes, and I've recently become extremely interested in JAMstack development!

I met James (VP of Product at Agility CMS) at** Start Up Open House**, which is a Tech Festival based in Toronto where a bunch of awesome companies in the Tech industry open their doors and allow people to tour their spaces, attend workshops, ask questions, and network.

Ever since  [James Vidler](https://twitter.com/JamesKVidler)and I connected there, we spoke to each other back and forth a few times, and one day James told me he might have a position that might interest me within Agility!

## Can you briefly tell us about your job title at Agility CMS?

**Joshua:** I'm currently a Support Developer at Agility CMS. Some of my tasks include actively monitoring tickets to provide support to our customers/developers, creating and improving our Help Center articles and guides, and also developer advocacy!

## What difficulties have you faced on your way using Agility CMS?

**Joshua:** Coming from a WordPress background, Agility CMS was very new to me, and took me a little while to get accustomed to the new CMS. With the use of Agility's great Help Center articles, the transition from a traditional WordPress CMS to Agility CMS was as smooth as butter üòä.

## Now, we see you're working at Agility CMS, how do you feel working with the team and doing things on JAMstack using Agility CMS?

**Joshua:** I've only been at Agility for a short period of time, but everyone on the team is amazing and super fun to work with! I've recently become a big fan of the JAMstack and being able to work with this technology at Agility is super exciting.

The JAMstack ecosystem is a hot space right now, and there are so many exciting things happening within it. Aside from our two JAMstack staters (Gatsby & Next.js Blog), we hope to release some more awesome JAMstack starter sites using Agility CMS.

## What do you think needs to be done while or before learning how to use Agility CMS?

**Joshua:** Before using Agility CMS I would check out these articles to see how Agility can empower and benefit both [Developers](https://agilitycms.com/product/for-developers) and [Editors](https://agilitycms.com/product/for-editors). While using Agility you can refer to our Help Center articles [here](https://help.agilitycms.com/hc/en-us).

## What is your favorite starter blog in Agility CMS and why is it your favorite starter blog?

 **Joshua:** My favorite Agility CMS starter at the moment is the Gatsby Blog Starter. I'm a big fan of Gatsby and being able to use Agility as the CMS to a Gatsby site super powerful and so much fun to work with.

## What does your development environment look like? Could you please share a photo of you working with Agility CMS in your development environment? :)

## Finally, what would be your message to people trying to get into Agility CMS?

**Joshua:** Just go for it! Sign up for a Free Account, and start off with one of our starters (Gatsby or Next) which saves you time configuring your project so you can start building awesome websites using Agility! We have awesome Help Center articles that explain how to get started, how things work, and how to deploy your [projects](https://help.agilitycms.com/hc/en-us). We also have a great Support team, join our community  [slack channel](https://agilitycms-community.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNzI2NDc3MzU4Njc2LWI2OTNjZTI3ZGY1NWRiNTYzNmEyNmI0MGZlZTRkYzI3NmRjNzkxYmI5YTZjNTg2ZTk4NGUzNjg5NzY3OWViZGI#/)  to stay up to date with Agility or to even ask questions!
