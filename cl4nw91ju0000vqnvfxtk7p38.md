# Building a web3 community with NFTs

This article is for people who are interested in web3 and NFTs too. This article covers everything on web3 community building, and its intersection with NFTs. If you do not have an idea of what web3 and NFTs are, this article will give you a brief overview of what they are - as they are exciting stuff â€˜everyoneâ€™ wants to learn about. There are a lot of benefits that come with being in web3 communities with NFTs, just as there are so many communities too.

## Web3 and NFTs are two different things ðŸ¤”.

**Web3** is the third version of the web, where everything is based on the blockchain. It uses blockchain, NFTs, and cryptocurrencies to give power back to the users in the form of ownership. Itâ€™s also known as the â€˜read-write-ownâ€™ web. Everything becomes decentralized. Web3 gives you ownership of digital assets. Web is all about decentralization - aiming to give users control over their data.

**NFTs** are or Non-fungible tokens are assets that are used to represent ownership of unique items. An NFT can have just one owner, and itâ€™s secured by the Ethereum blockchain. An NFT can be a digital art (videos, GIFs, music, pictures, and even collectibles). It can even be items like legal documents, or even signatures. 


## Web3 Communities ðŸ‘€

There are so many web3 communities, and every community comes with tons of benefits. They are most often called Social DAOs (where people come together to share ideas, 'how-tos', and also different opportunities). Web3 Communities for NFTs could be called Social DAOs. One of the best ways to keep building a web3 community is by sharing NFTs. Not just NFTs, but other NFT related projects, too. For example, a member creating an NFT marketplace and then sharing how you built it is another way to grow in a web3 community, and that is where web3 intersects with NFTs in a community, or even creating an NFT minting platform that mints Twitter posts and sharing contents (maybe an article or a video) about how it was built could help in building a community. 

A community without benefits feels like nothing. It should also be fun for its members, and NFTs have actually made web3 communities super fun. The community could also host giveaways and other exciting contests just to keep the members of the community engaged in the communityâ€™s activities.

In conclusion, there are so many web3 communities with NFTs you can join - you do not need to be a developer to  get into a web3 community with NFTs, you could probably be just a designer or something else. Web3 is the latest trend, you should get into it and the community itself. Thanks for taking the time to read this article. See you soon!
