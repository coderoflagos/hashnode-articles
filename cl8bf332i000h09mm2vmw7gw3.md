# How easy it is to get into Cloud Computing With Fermyon

# Introduction ‚ö°Ô∏è

In this article, readers understand what cloud computing is, what Spin is, how to get started with Spin, and how they can deploy their very first Spin application with Fermyon.

As humans, we love the easiest things. We love to work with better alternatives. Software Engineers in particular love using better options when it comes to technical-related stuff. This article is for people who are interested in WebAssembly for the Cloud. Also, if you do not know  how to get started, this article will walk you through how to get into Cloud Computing easily with [Spin](https://spin.fermyon.dev).

As developers, we enjoy getting good results from flexible technologies. Have you ever thought of building Microservices with Rust? If yes, this article is for you because you‚Äôll be introduced to a technology that works with the Fermyon Platform, and how easy it is to dive into the world of Cloud Computing with these technologies.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is a way of accessing data storage or cloud storage to manage or maintain them in a very fast and efficient way. Although this technology has been existing for so many years, there are different ways of storing or accessing data, but it‚Äôs become easier these days with just a few tools that can even be used for getting into cloud computing, including Spin. The Spin project  is currently being maintained by Fermyon. Without Cloud Computing, we could have been using some hardware devices to get data into storage and getting a hardware device could be quite expensive. Vercel, Netlify, Scaleway, or even Heroku are good examples of platforms that provide Cloud Computing as a service.

## Getting started with Fermyon üöÄü•≥

As a developer, it is not so easy to get on with different technology; In some cases, it can be weird - only if the technology is not as accessible as its harder alternative. 

Fermyon is a platform that helps to deploy Spin applications in such a very fast way. It‚Äôs a cloud application platform for deploying Spin applications. Of course, there are other platforms just like Heroku or Platform.sh - which serves as a cloud PaaS for deploying web apps. In Fermyon, even creating Spin applications is very easy with the help of the Spin CLI. 

To get started with using Fermyon, you need to get started with Spin. If you are familiar with technologies like Go or even Rust, then you will have no problems with developing Spin applications. Spin is a platform that provides accessibility to start using WebAssembly on the server. Using Spin provides security, scalability and portability for running Microservices.

Learning from [Spin‚Äôs Documentation](https://spin.fermyon.dev) is actually the best way to get started with learning if you do not have an idea on how to start. Spin was introduced earlier this year, and that way you can read the [blog post](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/introducing-spin) - Introducing Spin, to learn more about Spin. 

Here is a video below that could walk you through how to get started with Spin üëáüèæ:

In the video above, you‚Äôll get to learn how to use Spin, and create your very first ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù Program with Spin. As said above, you can also learn how to use Spin with the documentation - it gives a very detailed explanation about how to use Spin and even some of its use cases. For example; we have a use case explanation - [the URL Shortener with Spin tutorial](https://spin.fermyon.dev/url-shortener/). 

In this case, learning how to use Spin will be the best way to get started with Fermyon. And of course, using Fermyon to deploy your Spin application and  efficient and quick way to get into cloud computing. For deploying your Spin application to Fermyon, you need to run the ‚Äòspin deploy‚Äô command. There are two different ways you can run Fermyon, the first way is by running it locally and the other way is by running it with AWS. You can use the [Fermyon Documentation](http://fermyon.dev) to get through the steps on how to deploy your spin applications.

Here is a video for Fermyon‚Äôs Local Quickstart üëáüèæ:

In this video, you‚Äôll learn how to deploy your very first Spin Application with the ‚Äòspin deploy‚Äô command. We also have [a page in the documentation](https://www.fermyon.dev/quickstart-local) that could take you through how to deploy your Spin application locally.

Here is also a video for Fermyon‚Äôs AWS Quickstart üëáüèæ:

In this video, you will learn how to deploy your first Spin application with the AWS installer on Fermyon. You will need an AWS account and the Terraform CLI to start using this. We have a page in the documentation that could take you through how to run Fermyon on AWS.


## Conclusion üëãüèΩ

Cloud Computing has become more easy and even secure with platforms like Fermyon. From building and running microservices with Spin to deploying it on Fermyon, it‚Äôs really a nice thing to try out. This blog post briefly discussed how easy it really is to get into cloud computing even for people who barely have an idea on what to do. It also helped to showcase how Fermyon is being used for cloud computing.
