# Getting Started with Bunzz

## What is Bunzz?

[Bunzz](https://www.bunzz.dev) is the simplest and the most powerful to use DApp Integrated Development Environment. It’s mainly for making the creation of DApps accessible to ordinary developers. It is a platform that enables users to create their own smart contract, and list them in the marketplace. Bunzz makes the creation of smart contracts easier. You can call Bunzz  “Blockchain Backend As A Service (BBAAS) 🤣”

*(Why not try Bunzz out 🤷🏽‍♂️😝?)*

Jokes apart, it’s fun stuff to try out. Just as everyone loves what is accessible, We’ve got three layers of a deep - front-end, back-end, and Smart Contract (Bunzz primarily supports building the smart contract layer. As for the front-end and back-end, our boiler plate gives great tips).

And Bunzz allows users to configure DApps to deployment using its GUI. You do not need to learn much about before you dive into Bunzz. You can build everything easily as long as you have a knowledge of how to use SDKs. Having a knowledge of how JavaScript, React, or even Solidity will be an added advantage. Well, you could get into it with having just knowledge of coding. 

Bunzz provides different stuffs for its users. They are:

**Bunzz Console**: This takes a few minutes, it helps deploy your contracts easily. This is more reason why Bunzz is considered as the best, it’s stress free in terms of Deployment. You do not need much technical experience to do this.


**Bunzz SDK**: This has made life easy for Bunzz Users, You can just make your frontend application interact with your smart contract with the help of Bunzz SDK, it’s more like the main part of your application, because you definitely cannot see what you’ve done without the help of Bunzz SDK. Surprisingly, it has even been pretty much easy for people who also use Bubble - with the help of the [Plugin](https://bubble.io/plugin/bunzz-sdk-1638840374632x208258730430038000). In this case, if you use Bubble, you could use Bunzz easily.

Boilerplates/Tools: In this case, we have front-end boilerplates you could also use our Front-end boilerplates, we have just two at Bunzz, they are:

- [Token (ERC20)](https://github.com/lastrust/erc20-minting-boilerplate)
- [NFT (ERC721)](https://github.com/lastrust/erc721-minting-boilerplate)
These boilerplates are pretty much accessible that even someone who has a knowledge of JavaScript, React or Vue can use them.


 Bunzz saves its users from stress. Normally, you’d have to write some code to create a DApp or even a Smart Contract with Solidity and maybe other blockchain programming languages which might seem like a lot of stress for some people. Not everyone wants to get into technical stuffs - and this is where Bunzz comes in to the rescue. Over 2,000 people are using Bunzz already, it’d be great stuff to try out! You could check out this article - you will learn [how to generate an ERC20 with Bunzz and Bubble](https://asteroid.ac/articles/pp5bnhM43).

If you’re seeing this, you’re seeing Bunzz already. 

It helps saves stress, learning some blockchain technologies might be tiring, but with Bunzz, you can say “No stress” 🤣. It’d be great stuff if you join Bunzz today.
