# Introduction to Bitrise

Hello there, it's my tenth month as a Bitrise Expert, and I'm writing my very first technical article for Bitrise. It's been super interesting to watch people from different countries making huge contributions in the Bitrise Community.

## A quick guide to Bitrise

Bitrise was founded in 2014 - it's a super fast and complex service, it's also Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) Platform as a Service (PaaS), it helps you automate your daily app development tasks from building through testing to deployment. It allows developers to build, test and develop easily, it's very much accessible to developers. There a numerous mobile applications that rely on Bitrise for production, and also over 45,000 developers that rely on Bitrise to automate the build-, test- and deploy process for their applications - it is a collection of tools and services to help you with the development and automation of your software projects. Bitrise is actually used by tech companies like; TravelPerk, Paralect, Bunch, Tech Stack, Buzzvil, Travelex, Tonsser Stack, etc.

## Getting Started

To start using this service, you need to have a Bitrise account - you can create a Bitrise account either by using an Email, GitHub, BitBucket, or even GitLab accounts. After signing up, all you need to do is connect your Bitrise account to all of the three supported Git service providers. A two-week trial comes after signing up. 

After signing up, you can then start adding apps - adding a new app is very, actually; it's just like you're connecting a repository to Bitrise. Next, you choose the account where you want to add the app to. After doing this, you can set the privacy of the application, whether you want it to be public, or private - this is actually very important.

Next, you have to select the Git hosting service that hosts the repository, I'd recommend GitHub, or Bitbucket to anyone who is starting out to use Bitrise. When you're reminded to set up the repository's access, decline it, by pressing **No, auto-add SSH key**

Next, you'd have to put in the name of your branch that includes your project configuration. And, tap on **Next**. After doing this, Bitrise validates your project, so you have to wait for a while. After waiting, you will need to register a webhook in order for Bitrise to start a build automatically when code is pushed to your repository.

I've explained on getting started with Bitrise, if you need some more technical help, you can go ahead to read  [Bitrise's Documentation](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/getting-started-with-android-apps/). After doing all these I've mentioned, there's still a long way to go. You'd have to test your project, Sign In to your Android project, and Deploy your project to either Bitrise or Google Play Store. However, Bitrise is very easy, and flexible to use, it is also a great tool to incorporate in your projects. It is currently being used by over 100,000 developers. And it is also currently back by top investors like Y-Combinator, and Open Ocean. 

Bitrise also has a community that is open to anyone who needs help relating to Bitrise, the leaders in the community are called the Bitrise Experts, they write articles for Bitrise, represent Bitrise at the conferences/meetups they speak at, contribute to the community, and also create steps for the platform - basically, what they do is they act like a Developer Advocate for Bitrise. 

## In conclusion

Bitrise is a whole lot to talk about as it is pretty much accessible to use. Moreover, it boasts over 300 integrations with tools like Jira and Slack, it is being used all around the world . Thanks for taking out your time to read my article, it's been a long while since I've dropped something here on my blog, because I've been on a break off my tech career. I'd be doing more of this, keep an eye on my blog for stuffs like this. ðŸ˜€
