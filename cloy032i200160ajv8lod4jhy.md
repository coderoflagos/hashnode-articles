Hey folks,

I hope you're doing fine ✨👋🏽

It's been a while in the DevRel space, and there's a lot that has been going on. I lost so much confidence this year, and as a result, I've been mute on social media, trying to regain my confidence. I've explored different technologies, from WebRTC to cloud computing to WASM and AI.

Amidst all the struggles, I'm thrilled to share that I'm joining the amazing team at [Kapeta](https://kapeta.com/) as a DevRel 🎉. In this phase, I will be doing developer relations stuff. My major focus will be making Kapeta very accessible to its users and building a better community for Kapeta.

## Quick Intro to Kapeta

As you may know, I'm a big fan of dev products that aim to make life easy for its users. Kapeta is just one product that is trying to make things easy for its users. Kapeta is best described as a platform that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage cloud-native applications. It does this by breaking applications down into smaller, self-contained components called blocks. Each block has its own inputs and outputs, which makes it easy to share and reuse code.

There's a lot we're building, and I'm very sure you can't wait to see some of the amazing things we're building at Kapeta!

## Anything else?

If you have any questions about Kapeta, feel free to ask. You can find me on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/iambolajiayo); my DM is always open!

Lastly, thanks to everyone who has contributed to my career over the years, I'm willing to give back to the community that made me, always!
